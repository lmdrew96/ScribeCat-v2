## Welcome to ScribeCat

These Terms of Service ("Terms") are a legal agreement between you and ADHD: Agentic Development of Human Designs ("we," "us," "ScribeCat"). By using ScribeCat, you agree to these Terms.

**Don't like legalese?** Neither do we. We've written these terms as clearly as possible. But here's the ultra-short version:

- Be at least 16 years old
- Use ScribeCat legally and responsibly
- You own your content; we own the software
- ScribeCat is free and provided "as-is" (no guarantees it'll be perfect)
- We'll never sell your data
- Be decent to others if you collaborate
- Contact us if there's a problem

Now, the full version:

---

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By downloading, installing, or using ScribeCat, you agree to these Terms and our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md).

If you don't agree, don't use ScribeCat. Simple as that.

**Age Requirement:** You must be at least 16 years old to use ScribeCat. By using the app, you confirm you meet this requirement.

## 2. What ScribeCat Is

ScribeCat is a free, open-source desktop application for:
- Recording audio (lectures, meetings, interviews, etc.)
- Generating real-time transcriptions using AI
- Taking and organizing notes
- Creating study materials (flashcards, summaries, quizzes)
- Collaborating with others on shared sessions

**Key points:**
- **Free:** No subscription, no fees, no hidden costs

- **Optional cloud sync:** Sign in to sync across devices or collaborate
- **Open development:** Source code available on GitHub

---

## 3. Your Account & Registration

### 3.1 Creating an Account (Optional)
You can use ScribeCat without an account (local-only mode). To use cloud sync or collaboration features, you'll need to create an account.

**Account security is your responsibility:**
- Choose a strong password
- Keep your login credentials private
- Don't share your account with others
- Notify us immediately if your account is compromised (scribecatscribes@gmail.com)

### 3.2 Account Termination
- **You can leave anytime:** Delete your account by contacting us at scribecatscribes@gmail.com
- **We can terminate accounts:** We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms (though we really hope we never have to)

## 4. Your Content & Ownership

### 4.1 You Own Your Content
**Everything you create in ScribeCat is yours:**
- Recordings you make
- Transcriptions generated from your audio
- Notes you write
- Study materials you create or generate with AI

We claim zero ownership over your content. It's yours to keep, export, share, or delete as you see fit.

### 4.2 Our Limited Use Rights
To provide ScribeCat's features, you grant us permission to:
- Store your content on our servers (if you use cloud sync)
- Process your content through third-party AI services (AssemblyAI for transcription, Claude for study features)
- Display your content to people you share it with (if you use collaboration features)

**This is purely functional.** We don't use your content for marketing, advertising, or any other purpose. See our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md) for details.

### 4.3 Content You Share
If you share sessions with other users:
- People with "viewer" access can view your content
- People with "editor" access can view and modify your content
- You can revoke shares anytime
- Be mindful of what you share—you're responsible for who you grant access to

### 4.4 Responsibility for Your Content
You're responsible for ensuring:
- You have the right to record audio (don't record people without permission where illegal)
- Your content doesn't violate anyone's intellectual property rights

- Keeping your data secure with industry-standard practices
- Being transparent about how we handle data
- Giving you control over your data (export, delete, etc.)

### 7.3 Updates & Changes

---

## 8. Disclaimers & Limitations

### 8.1 "As-Is" Service
ScribeCat is provided **"as-is"** and **"as available"** without warranties of any kind, either express or implied.

**In plain English:** We've built ScribeCat with care, but we can't guarantee it'll be perfect. Software has bugs. Transcriptions may have errors. AI-generated content may not be accurate.

**We disclaim warranties including (but not limited to):**
- Merchantability (fitness for a particular purpose)
- Accuracy of transcriptions or AI-generated content
- Uninterrupted or error-free operation
- Data loss prevention (back up your important stuff!)
- Compatibility with all systems or devices

### 8.2 Use at Your Own Risk
You understand and agree that:
- Transcriptions may contain errors—always review important content
- AI-generated study materials are supplemental tools, not replacements for actual studying
- You're responsible for backing up important data
- Recording laws vary by jurisdiction—know your local laws before recording others

### 8.3 Educational Tool Disclaimer
ScribeCat is a study aid, not a substitute for:
- Attending class or lectures
- Reading assigned materials
- Critical thinking and comprehension
- Academic integrity (don't use AI-generated content to cheat)

**You're responsible for using ScribeCat ethically and in compliance with your institution's academic policies.**

---

## 9. Limitation of Liability

### 9.1 What We're Not Liable For
To the maximum extent permitted by law, ADHD: Agentic Development of Human Designs and the ScribeCat team are **not liable** for:

- **Data loss:** Always back up important recordings and notes
- **Transcription errors:** AI transcription isn't perfect; verify critical information
- **Missed deadlines or poor grades:** ScribeCat is a tool, not a guarantee of academic success
- **Third-party service failures:** We don't control AssemblyAI, Claude, or Supabase
- **Indirect damages:** Lost profits, lost data, or consequential damages
- **User-generated content:** We're not responsible for content you or others create

### 9.2 Liability Cap
If we are found liable for any damages, our total liability is limited to the amount you paid for ScribeCat in the past 12 months.

**Since ScribeCat is free, that's $0.**

This may sound harsh, but it's standard for free software and protects us from unreasonable liability while we provide a free service.

### 9.3 Exceptions
Some jurisdictions don't allow liability limitations for certain damages (like personal injury or fraud). If that applies to you, these limitations may not apply.

---

## 10. Indemnification

**In plain English:** If your use of ScribeCat causes legal trouble, you're responsible—not us.

You agree to indemnify (legally: "hold harmless") ADHD: Agentic Development of Human Designs from claims, damages, or expenses arising from:
- Your violation of these Terms
- Your violation of any laws or third-party rights
- Content you create or share
- Your use or misuse of ScribeCat

**Example:** If you illegally record someone and they sue, that's on you—not us.

---

## 11. Intellectual Property

### 11.1 ScribeCat Software
The ScribeCat application, code, design, and branding are owned by ADHD: Agentic Development of Human Designs and protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws.

**Open Source:** ScribeCat is open-source software. You can view, modify, and distribute the source code under the terms of our open-source license (see GitHub repository).

### 11.2 Trademarks
"ScribeCat" and the ScribeCat logo are trademarks of ADHD: Agentic Development of Human Designs. You can't use them without permission (except to refer to the software itself).

### 11.3 Your Feedback
If you provide feedback, suggestions, or bug reports:
- Thank you! We appreciate it.
- We may use your feedback to improve ScribeCat without compensating you
- You retain no ownership over how we implement your suggestions

## 12. Dispute Resolution

### 12.1 Contact Us First
If you have a problem with ScribeCat, please contact us at scribecatscribes@gmail.com before taking legal action.

We're reasonable people and will work with you to resolve issues.

### 12.2 Informal Resolution
Most disputes can be resolved through friendly communication. We commit to:
- Responding to your concern within 5 business days
- Working in good faith to find a solution
- Being transparent about what we can and can't do

### 12.3 Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States (and the state where ADHD: Agentic Development of Human Designs is located), without regard to conflict of law principles.

### 12.4 Arbitration (If Needed)
If we can't resolve a dispute informally, we agree to binding arbitration rather than going to court.

**Arbitration details:**
- Conducted by a neutral arbitrator
- Location: Virtual or mutually agreed location
- Costs: Each party pays their own costs (we won't make you pay ours)
- Class action waiver: Disputes must be resolved individually (no class actions)

**Exception:** Either party can seek injunctive relief in court to protect intellectual property rights.

### 12.5 Your Rights
Some jurisdictions give you rights that can't be waived by arbitration clauses. If that applies to you, those rights are preserved.

- You engage in illegal activity
- You abuse or harm the service
- Required by law

We'll provide notice when possible (except for serious violations requiring immediate action).

### 13.3 Effect of Termination
After termination:
- Your access to cloud features is revoked
- Your data may be deleted after 30 days (per our trash retention policy)
- You can still export your data during this period
- Sections of these Terms that should survive (liability, disputes, etc.) remain in effect

## 14. General Terms

These Terms and our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md) constitute the entire agreement between you and ScribeCat.

### 14.2 Changes to Terms

### 14.3 Severability
If any part of these Terms is found invalid or unenforceable, the rest remains in effect.

### 14.4 No Waiver
If we don't enforce a part of these Terms, that doesn't mean we waive the right to enforce it later.

### 14.5 Assignment
You can't transfer these Terms to anyone else. We may transfer our rights and obligations to a successor organization (e.g., if ScribeCat is acquired).

### 14.6 Force Majeure
