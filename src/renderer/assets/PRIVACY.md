# ScribeCat Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** December 5, 2025
**Contact:** scribecatscribes@gmail.com
**Company:** ADHD: Agentic Development of Human Designs

## Our Privacy Promise

**We will NEVER sell your data. Period.**

We built ScribeCat because we believe in data privacy and data ownership. Your recordings, notes, and study materials belong to you—not us, not advertisers, not anyone else.

This privacy policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and the rights you have. We've written it in plain English because we respect your time and intelligence.

---

## The Short Version

- **Local-first:** Your data lives on your device by default. Cloud sync is optional.
- **No tracking:** We don't collect analytics, telemetry, usage stats, or behavioral data.
- **No selling:** We will never sell, rent, or trade your data. Ever.
- **Third-party AI:** We use AssemblyAI for transcription and Claude AI for study features. They process your data but don't store it permanently.
- **Optional cloud:** If you sign in, your data syncs to Supabase (encrypted in transit). You can use ScribeCat entirely offline if you prefer.
- **Your control:** Export your data anytime. Delete it anytime. It's yours.

---

## 3. What We DON'T Collect

Let's be crystal clear about what we don't do:

- ❌ **No IP address logging:** We don't log or store IP addresses (third-party services may as part of normal operations)
- ❌ **No browsing history or other apps:** ScribeCat only accesses data you explicitly create within the app
- ❌ **No selling or trading data:** We will never monetize your data. This is a core principle.

The only data stored in your browser is:
