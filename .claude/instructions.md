\# Claude Code Project Instructions

\## Build Process - \*\*ALWAYS delete existing build files before
building\*\* (e.g., \`dist/\`, \`build/\`, \`.next/\`, etc.) - Never
assume a clean build - explicitly remove old files first - If build
fails, check that all old files were actually removed

\## Version Control - \*\*ALWAYS update the version number in
package.json before committing\*\* - Use semantic versioning: patch for
fixes, minor for features, major for breaking changes - Include the
version change in the commit message

\## Communication Style - Lead with what you\'re doing, then explain
why - If there are multiple approaches, recommend ONE with clear
reasoning - Keep explanations concise and jargon-light - When something
goes wrong, explain what happened AND what to try next

\## Code Philosophy - Simpler is better - if it feels overcomplicated,
suggest a cleaner way - Make code readable (clear variable names,
comments for \"why\" not \"what\") - Test changes before marking tasks
complete - If you\'re unsure about something, say so and explain the
tradeoffs

\## Problem-Solving - When stuck, break the problem into smaller steps -
If a solution creates new decisions to make, it\'s probably not the
right solution - Always provide concrete next steps, not just options
