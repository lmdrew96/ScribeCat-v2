# Claude Code Instructions for ScribeCat v2

## About This Project
ScribeCat v2 is an Electron desktop app for transcription, note-taking, and collaborative studying. Current version: **1.90.0**

**Tech Stack:** Electron 38 + Vite, TypeScript (strict mode), TipTap rich-text editor, Yjs for CRDT collaboration, Supabase backend, AssemblyAI transcription, Claude AI integration

## Core Philosophy

**NO BANDAID FIXES - ONLY SOLUTIONS TO THE ROOT CAUSE!**

If something's broken, fix it properly. Don't patch over symptoms - diagnose and solve the actual problem. Quick hacks create technical debt.

**Examples:**
- BAD: "Let's add a try-catch to hide that error"
- GOOD: "That error means X is misconfigured. Let's fix the config."
- BAD: "Just restart the service when it fails"
- GOOD: "The service is failing because of Y. Let's fix Y."

**COMPLETE ALL ASPECTS OF EVERY PLAN!**

When given a task or plan, execute it fully. Don't stop partway through or leave loose ends. If a plan has 5 steps, complete all 5. If you're implementing a feature, finish all its components before moving on.

**Examples:**
- BAD: Implementing 3 of 5 planned functions and saying "the rest follows the same pattern"
- GOOD: Implementing all 5 functions completely
- BAD: Creating a component without its styles, tests, or integration
- GOOD: Delivering the complete, working feature

## 🚦 Before You Start ANY Work

1. **Check version** in package.json (currently v1.90.0)
2. **Run `npm run clean`** to delete old build artifacts
3. **Read these instructions** fully before coding

## ⛔ CRITICAL: Do NOT Run `npm run dev`

**`npm run dev` does not work in this project.** It fails in Claude Code for unresolved reasons. Do not attempt to run it unless explicitly asked to debug it.

**Instead, use:**
- `npm run compile` — Compile TypeScript
- `npm run build` — Full production build

This is a known issue we'll address eventually, but for now, avoid `npm run dev` entirely.

## Architecture Pattern: Supabase Realtime

**CRITICAL:** Supabase Realtime WebSockets **DO NOT work** in Electron's main process. They require a browser environment (localStorage, proper WebSocket support).

### ✅ DO: Subscribe directly in renderer manager

```typescript
const client = RendererSupabaseClient.getInstance().getClient();
this.channel = client
  .channel(`feature-${userId}`)
  .on('postgres_changes', { 
    event: 'INSERT', 
    schema: 'public', 
    table: 'my_table' 
  }, handler)
  .subscribe();
```

### ❌ DON'T: Create IPC handlers for subscriptions

```typescript
// WRONG - WebSocket in main process, data flows through IPC
this.handle(ipcMain, 'feature:subscribe', async (event) => {
  this.repository.subscribeToFeature(userId, (data) => {
    event.sender.send('feature:update', data);
  });
});
```

**Why this matters:**
- WebSockets need browser APIs that main process doesn't have
- Realtime events won't be delivered if subscribed in main process
- Managers should use `RendererSupabaseClient` directly for all realtime features

## Critical Build Requirements

### ALWAYS Clean Before Building
```bash
npm run clean   # Delete dist/ folder
# OR manually: rm -rf dist/
```
**Why:** Old build files cause mysterious bugs. Start fresh every time.

### ALWAYS Update Version Before Commits
Update `version` in package.json using semantic versioning:
- **Patch** (1.90.0 → 1.90.1): Bug fixes
- **Minor** (1.90.0 → 1.91.0): New features
- **Major** (1.90.0 → 2.0.0): Breaking changes

**Commit format:** `"v1.90.1: Brief description of change"`

## Build Process

```bash
npm run compile          # Compile TypeScript
npm run build            # Full production build
npm run build:mac/win/linux  # Platform-specific builds
npm run clean            # Delete dist/
```

**⛔ DO NOT USE:** `npm run dev` — It's broken and will not work.

**Build outputs:** `dist/main/`, `dist/preload/`, `dist/renderer/`

## IPC Channels (Key Categories)

**Recording:** `recording:start/stop/pause/resume/getStatus`
**Transcription:** `transcription:assemblyai:*`
**AI:** `ai:chat`, `ai:chatStream`, `ai:polishTranscription`, `ai:generate*`
**Sessions:** `sessions:list/delete/update`, `session:export/create*`
**Auth:** `auth:signIn*/signUp*/signOut/getCurrentUser`
**Cloud:** `sync:upload*/get*/retry*`, `drive:*`
**Sharing:** `share:create/remove/update*`, `share:getShared*`
**Friends:** `friends:get*/send*/accept*/search*`, `friends:*Presence`
**Rooms:** `rooms:create/join/leave/update*`
**Chat:** `chat:send*/get*/subscribe*`
**Games:** `games:create*/start/complete`, `games:*question*`, `games:*score*`

## How to Communicate with Lanae ⚡

**Lead with ACTION, then explain WHY:**
✅ "Run `npm run clean` to delete old build files that cause bugs"  
❌ "You might want to consider cleaning the build directory"

**No Decision Paralysis:**
- Max 2-3 options with pros/cons
- **Always recommend ONE** with clear reasoning
- Example: "Use Option A because X is your priority"

**Keep it Simple:**
- Break big tasks into 3-5 concrete steps
- Use code examples
- Pivot quickly if something isn't working

**Never:**
- Dump 5+ options without a recommendation
- Use vague suggestions like "you could try..."
- Suggest bandaid fixes that don't address root causes
- Leave tasks partially completed

## Testing

```bash
npm run test              # Watch mode
npm run test:run          # Run once
npm run test:coverage     # Check coverage (target: >80%)
npm run test:ui           # Visual UI
```

**Stack:** Vitest + @testing-library

## Code Standards

**Rules:**
- TypeScript strict mode - avoid `any`
- Files under 500 lines
- Single responsibility functions
- JSDoc comments on public APIs
- Repository pattern for data access

**When making changes:**
1. Check existing patterns first
2. Ask: "Am I fixing root cause or patching symptoms?"
3. Test locally before committing
4. Clean build (`npm run clean`) before final testing
5. Update version in package.json
6. **Complete ALL aspects of the plan before moving on**

## Security

- **NEVER expose API keys in code or logs**
- Store credentials in OS credential manager
- Validate all user input
- All API calls over HTTPS
- User data stays local by default

## Database

**Supabase (Cloud):**
- PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security
- Tables: sessions, transcriptions, users, friends, study_rooms, room_participants, chat_messages, game_sessions, game_questions, player_scores, shares, yjs_state, presence, room_invitations
- Realtime subscriptions for live updates
- 46+ migrations implementing features

**Local:**
- electron-store for settings
- Audio files in user data directory

## Workflow Summary

1. **Starting work:** Check issues or ask what to work on
2. **Before building:** `npm run clean`
3. **After changes:** Test locally (use `npm run compile` or `npm run build`, NOT `npm run dev`)
4. **Before committing:** Update version, include in commit message
5. **Commit format:** `"v1.x.x: Brief description"`
6. **Always:** Complete all aspects of the plan — no partial implementations
