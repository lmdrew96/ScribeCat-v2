# ScribeCat Installation Instructions

## For macOS Users

ScribeCat is currently distributed as an **unsigned application**. macOS Gatekeeper will initially block it from opening. Here's how to install and run it:

### Option 1: Right-Click Method (Recommended)

1. Download and extract ScribeCat
2. **Right-click** (or Control+click) on **ScribeCat.app**
3. Select **"Open"** from the menu
4. Click **"Open"** in the dialog that appears
5. The app will now run - you only need to do this once!

### Option 2: System Settings Method

1. Try to open ScribeCat.app normally (it will be blocked)
2. Open **System Settings** (or System Preferences on older macOS)
3. Go to **Privacy & Security**
4. Scroll down to find the message about ScribeCat being blocked
5. Click **"Open Anyway"**
6. Try opening ScribeCat again and confirm

### ZIP vs DMG Download

- **ZIP file**: Extract and use the Right-Click method above
- **DMG file**: If you see a "damaged" error, use the ZIP file instead

### Why These Steps Are Needed

ScribeCat is not code-signed with an Apple Developer certificate (which costs $99/year). This is a common situation for free, open-source, or independent software. macOS is just being extra cautious with apps from unrecognized developers.

### Is It Safe?

Yes! These warnings don't mean the app is malicious - they only mean Apple hasn't verified the developer. You can review the source code on GitHub to verify the app's safety.
