# Canvas LMS Hybrid Integration - Implementation Complete

## Overview

ScribeCat v2 now supports Canvas LMS integration through a **hybrid approach** that works for all universities:

1. **Canvas API** (Method 1) - Direct API integration for universities that allow API access
2. **Browser Extension** (Method 2) - DOM scraping fallback for universities that block API access (like University of Delaware)

## Implementation Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - All core functionality implemented and ready for testing

### Completed Components

#### Backend (Main Process)
- ✅ `src/domain/services/ICanvasService.ts` - Domain interface
- ✅ `src/infrastructure/services/canvas/CanvasService.ts` - Canvas API service
- ✅ `src/main/ipc/handlers/CanvasHandlers.ts` - IPC handlers with import/export support
- ✅ Canvas configuration stored securely in electron-store

#### Frontend (Renderer Process)
- ✅ `src/renderer/index.html` - Canvas settings UI with both methods
- ✅ `src/renderer/settings.ts` - Full Canvas management logic
- ✅ Course import from JSON
- ✅ Course list display with delete functionality
- ✅ Extension help modal

#### Browser Extension
- ✅ `browser-extension/manifest.json` - Updated to v2.0.0
- ✅ `browser-extension/scripts/content-script.js` - DOM scraping logic
- ✅ `browser-extension/scripts/background.js` - Extension background service
- ✅ `browser-extension/popup/popup.html` - Extension popup UI

#### Type Definitions
- ✅ `src/preload/preload.ts` - Canvas API exposure
- ✅ `src/shared/window.d.ts` - TypeScript definitions

## How It Works

### Method 1: Canvas API (Recommended)

**For universities that allow API access:**

1. User enters Canvas URL and API token in settings
2. ScribeCat tests connection via Canvas REST API
3. Courses are fetched automatically via `/api/v1/courses`
4. Credentials stored securely in electron-store

**Advantages:**
- Automatic course sync
- Real-time updates
- No manual steps required

### Method 2: Browser Extension (Universal Fallback)

**For universities that block API access:**

1. User installs ScribeCat Canvas Browser Extension
2. Extension scrapes course data from Canvas dashboard HTML
3. User exports JSON from extension popup
4. User pastes JSON into ScribeCat settings
5. Courses imported and stored locally

**Advantages:**
- Works universally (no API restrictions)
- No authentication required
- Privacy-focused (data stays local)

## Browser Extension Details

### Installation

```bash
# Chrome/Edge
1. Open chrome://extensions/
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the browser-extension folder

# Firefox
1. Open about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox
2. Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
3. Select manifest.json from browser-extension folder
```

### Usage

1. Navigate to your Canvas dashboard
2. Click the ScribeCat extension icon
3. Click "Export Courses" button
4. JSON data is copied to clipboard
5. Paste into ScribeCat settings → Canvas → Method 2

### JSON Format

```json
{
  "source": "ScribeCat Canvas Browser Extension",
  "format": "scribecat_course_import_v1",
  "courses": [
    {
      "id": "course_123456",
      "code": "CISC108",
      "title": "Introduction to Computer Science I",
      "url": "https://canvas.university.edu/courses/123456"
    }
  ]
}
```

### DOM Selectors

The extension uses multiple selectors to handle different Canvas layouts:

```javascript
// Standard Canvas selectors
'.ic-DashboardCard__header-title'
'.ic-DashboardCard__link'

// University of Delaware specific
'.course-list-item'
'.course-code'
'.course-title'
```

## API Reference

### IPC Handlers

```typescript
// Configure Canvas API
canvas:configure(config: { baseUrl: string; apiToken: string })

// Test API connection
canvas:test-connection()

// Get courses via API
canvas:get-courses()

// Check if configured
canvas:is-configured()

// Get config (without token)
canvas:get-config()

// Disconnect API
canvas:disconnect()

// Import courses from JSON
canvas:import-courses(jsonData: string)

// Get imported courses
canvas:get-imported-courses()

// Delete imported course
canvas:delete-imported-course(courseId: string)
```

### Renderer API

```typescript
window.scribeCat.canvas.configure(config)
window.scribeCat.canvas.testConnection()
window.scribeCat.canvas.getCourses()
window.scribeCat.canvas.isConfigured()
window.scribeCat.canvas.getConfig()
window.scribeCat.canvas.disconnect()
window.scribeCat.canvas.importCourses(jsonData)
window.scribeCat.canvas.getImportedCourses()
window.scribeCat.canvas.deleteImportedCourse(courseId)
```

## UI Features

### Settings Modal - Canvas Section

**Method 1: Canvas API**
- Canvas URL input field
- API token input field (password type)
- Test Connection button
- Disconnect button
- Status indicator

**Method 2: Browser Extension**
- JSON textarea for paste
- Import Courses button
- Extension help link (opens modal)
- Imported courses list with:
  - Course code and title display
  - Delete button per course
  - Course count indicator

### Help Modal

Provides step-by-step instructions for:
- Installing the browser extension
- Exporting courses from Canvas
- Importing into ScribeCat
- Why the extension is needed

## Security Considerations

✅ **API tokens stored securely** in electron-store (main process only)
✅ **Tokens never exposed** to renderer process
✅ **HTTPS-only** API communication
✅ **Input validation** on JSON imports
✅ **No credentials in logs** or error messages

- [ ] Bulk operations by course

## Known Limitations

1. **Browser Extension**
   - Requires manual export/import
   - No automatic sync
   - Depends on Canvas HTML structure

2. **Canvas API**
   - Not available at all universities
   - Requires user to generate token
   - Token expiration handling needed

3. **General**
   - No course selection in recording UI yet
   - No course-based file organization yet
   - No assignment integration yet

## Troubleshooting

### Canvas API Issues

**"Connection failed"**
- Verify Canvas URL is correct
- Check API token is valid
- Ensure university allows API access
- Try Method 2 (browser extension)

**"Invalid credentials"**
- Regenerate API token in Canvas
- Check token wasn't copied with extra spaces
- Verify token has correct permissions

### Browser Extension Issues

**"Invalid JSON format"**
- Ensure you copied the complete JSON
- Check for truncation or corruption
- Re-export from extension

**"No courses found"**
- Verify you're on Canvas dashboard
- Check extension has permissions
- Try refreshing the page

## Architecture Notes

### Clean Architecture Compliance

✅ **Domain Layer** - Pure business logic (ICanvasService interface)
✅ **Application Layer** - Use cases (handled by infrastructure)
✅ **Infrastructure Layer** - External services (CanvasService, electron-store)
✅ **Presentation Layer** - UI logic (settings.ts, index.html)

### Dependency Flow

```
Renderer (settings.ts)
    ↓ IPC
Main (CanvasHandlers.ts)
    ↓
Infrastructure (CanvasService.ts)
    ↓
Domain (ICanvasService.ts)
```
