# Auto-Polish Transcription Implementation

## Overview

Auto-polish is a feature that automatically polishes live transcription at jittered intervals during recording. It uses Claude AI to improve grammar, punctuation, and clarity while preserving the original meaning.

## Implementation Date
October 29, 2025

## Architecture

### Components Modified

1. **src/renderer/index.html**
   - Added auto-polish settings section in settings modal
   - Includes toggle, interval, jitter, min words, and full polish interval settings

2. **src/renderer/settings.ts**
   - Added auto-polish settings state management
   - Handles loading/saving settings to electron-store
   - Manages UI visibility for auto-polish options

3. **src/renderer/ai/features/PolishFeature.ts**
   - Extended with auto-polish state and methods
   - Implements jittered interval timer logic
   - Provides incremental and full polish capabilities
   - Includes visual indicator for polish operations

4. **src/renderer/ai/AIManager.ts**
   - Added methods to start/stop auto-polish
   - Loads settings and passes them to PolishFeature
   - Checks if AI is configured before starting

5. **src/renderer/managers/RecordingManager.ts**
   - Integrated auto-polish with recording lifecycle
   - Starts auto-polish when recording begins
   - Stops auto-polish when recording ends

6. **src/renderer/app.ts**
   - Updated initialization order (AIManager before RecordingManager)
   - Passes AIManager to RecordingManager constructor

## Features

### Settings (Default Values)

- **Enable Auto-Polish**: OFF by default (opt-in)
- **Polish Interval**: 30 seconds
- **Jitter Range**: ±5 seconds
- **Minimum Words**: 50 words before polishing
- **Full Polish Interval**: Every 5 cycles (~2.5 minutes)

### Polishing Strategy

1. **Incremental Polish** (default)
   - Polishes only new text since last polish
   - Occurs every ~30 seconds (with jitter)
   - Requires minimum word count threshold

2. **Full Polish** (periodic)
   - Re-polishes entire transcription
   - Occurs every 5 incremental cycles
   - Ensures consistency across the document

### Jittered Intervals

The system uses randomized timing to prevent predictable patterns:
```
nextInterval = baseInterval + random(-jitter, +jitter)
Example: 30s ± 5s = 25-35 seconds
```

### Visual Feedback

- Subtle indicator appears in top-right corner during polishing
- Shows "Polishing..." during operation
- Shows "Polished ✓" on completion (2 seconds)
- Automatically fades out

### Smart Polishing Logic

- Skips polish if fewer than minimum words added
- Continues scheduling even if polish fails
- Preserves scroll position during updates
- Maintains user's reading context

## User Experience

### Enabling Auto-Polish

1. Open Settings (⚙️ button)
2. Scroll to "Auto-Polish Transcription" section
3. Check "Enable Auto-Polish"
4. Adjust settings if desired (optional)
5. Save Settings
6. Start recording - auto-polish will activate automatically

### During Recording

- Auto-polish runs silently in the background
- Brief indicator shows when polishing occurs
- Transcription updates seamlessly
- No interruption to recording or transcription

### Requirements

- Claude AI must be configured with valid API key
- Auto-polish must be enabled in settings
- Recording must be active

## Technical Details

### Error Handling

- Gracefully handles API failures
- Continues scheduling next polish on error
- Logs errors to console without disrupting recording
- Never shows alerts during auto-polish

### Performance Considerations

- Uses jittered delays (1.2-2.0s) between API calls
- Tracks last polish position to avoid re-polishing
- Incremental approach reduces token usage
- Full polish ensures consistency

### Storage Keys

Settings are stored in electron-store:
```
'auto-polish-enabled': boolean (default: false)
'auto-polish-interval': number (default: 30)
'auto-polish-jitter': number (default: 5)
'auto-polish-min-words': number (default: 50)
'auto-polish-full-interval': number (default: 5)
```

## Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **Simulation Mode**
   - Enable auto-polish
   - Start recording in simulation mode
   - Verify polish indicator appears at intervals
   - Check console logs for polish operations

2. **AssemblyAI Mode**
   - Enable auto-polish
   - Start recording with AssemblyAI
   - Verify polish works with real-time transcription
   - Check transcription quality improvements

3. **Settings Persistence**
   - Change auto-polish settings
   - Save and close app
   - Reopen and verify settings retained

4. **Error Handling**
   - Disable Claude AI
   - Enable auto-polish
   - Start recording
   - Verify graceful handling (logs, no crashes)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Configurable polish options (grammar only, punctuation only, etc.)
- User-selectable polish aggressiveness
- Statistics tracking (polishes performed, tokens used)
- Manual trigger for immediate polish
- Undo/redo for polish operations

## Notes

- Auto-polish is opt-in to respect user preferences
- Works with both simulation and AssemblyAI modes
- Designed to be non-intrusive and efficient
- Follows Clean Architecture principles
- Maintains separation of concerns
