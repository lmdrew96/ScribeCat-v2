# Floating AI Chat Button & Drawer Implementation

## Overview
Moved the AI Chat functionality from a header button to a floating action button (FAB) with a slide-out drawer interface. This improves UX by:
- Decluttering the header
- Making AI chat persistently accessible
- Providing a more modern, mobile-friendly interaction pattern

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Structure (`src/renderer/index.html`)

**Removed:**
- AI Chat button from the Live Transcription header panel actions
- Old `ai-chat-panel` that was positioned inside the right panel

**Added:**
- Floating action button (`floating-chat-btn`) positioned at bottom-right
- New drawer structure (`ai-chat-drawer`) with:
  - Backdrop overlay for click-to-close
  - Drawer content that slides in from the right
  - All existing chat functionality (messages, input, options)

### 2. CSS Styling (`src/renderer/styles.css`)

**Floating Button:**
- Fixed position: bottom-right (24px from edges)
- Size: 56x56px circular button
- Gradient background (accent blue)
- Hover effects: scale up, enhanced shadow
- Z-index: 900 (below drawer but above main content)

**Drawer:**
- Fixed overlay covering full viewport
- Drawer content: 400px wide, slides from right
- Smooth animations: 300ms cubic-bezier easing
- Backdrop: semi-transparent with blur effect
- Z-index: 1000 (above everything)

**Responsive:**
- Mobile: Drawer takes full width
- Mobile: Floating button slightly smaller (48x48px)

### 3. JavaScript Logic (`src/renderer/ai-manager.ts`)

**Updated References:**
- `chatPanel` → `chatDrawer`
- `toggleChatBtn` → `floatingChatBtn`
- `closeChatBtn` → `closeDrawerBtn`
- Added `drawerBackdrop` reference

**New Event Listeners:**
- Floating button opens drawer
- Close button closes drawer
- Backdrop click closes drawer
- Escape key closes drawer

**Accessibility Features:**
- Focus trap: Tab navigation stays within drawer when open
- Focus management: Input gets focus on open, button gets focus on close
- ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation: Escape to close

**Animation Timing:**
- 300ms delay before focusing input (waits for slide animation)
- Smooth transitions for all state changes

## User Experience

### Opening Chat:
1. Click floating button in bottom-right corner
2. Drawer slides in from right with backdrop fade-in
3. Input field receives focus (if AI configured)
4. Focus is trapped within drawer

### Closing Chat:
1. Click X button in drawer header
2. Click backdrop overlay
3. Press Escape key
4. Drawer slides out, backdrop fades out
5. Focus returns to floating button

### Chat Functionality:
- All existing features preserved:
  - Message history with streaming responses
  - Context options (transcription/notes)
  - Polish and Summarize buttons still in header
  - Settings integration unchanged

## Technical Details

### Z-Index Hierarchy:
- Main app: 0-100
- Floating button: 900
- Drawer: 1000
- Modals (Polish/Summary): 2000

### Animation Performance:
- CSS transforms (translateX) for smooth 60fps animation
- Hardware acceleration via transform
- Backdrop opacity transition
- No JavaScript animation libraries needed

### Accessibility Compliance:
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly (ARIA labels)
- Focus management
- High contrast support via CSS variables

## Testing Checklist

✅ Floating button visible and clickable
✅ Drawer slides in/out smoothly
✅ Chat functionality works as before
✅ Escape key closes drawer
✅ Clicking backdrop closes drawer
✅ Focus trap works correctly
✅ Focus returns to button on close
✅ No z-index conflicts

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Badge on floating button showing unread message count
- Swipe gesture to close drawer on mobile
- Drawer resize handle for user preference
- Multiple drawer positions (left/right toggle)
- Minimize drawer to floating preview
- Keyboard shortcut to toggle drawer (e.g., Cmd+K)

## Files Modified

1. `src/renderer/index.html` - HTML structure
2. `src/renderer/styles.css` - Styling and animations
3. `src/renderer/ai-manager.ts` - Logic and event handling

## Compatibility

- Works with existing AI integration
- Compatible with all transcription modes
- No breaking changes to API or data structures
- Maintains all existing functionality
