# Canvas LMS Integration - Phase 3 Implementation

## Overview

Canvas LMS integration has been successfully implemented in ScribeCat v2, allowing users to connect their Canvas account, fetch enrolled courses, and organize recordings by course.

## Implementation Date
October 29, 2025

## Architecture

### Domain Layer
- **Interface**: `src/domain/services/ICanvasService.ts`
  - Defines the contract for Canvas LMS operations
  - Types: `CanvasCourse`, `CanvasConfig`

### Infrastructure Layer
- **Service**: `src/infrastructure/services/canvas/CanvasService.ts`
  - Implements Canvas API communication
  - Handles authentication and course fetching
  - Validates connections before storing credentials

### Main Process
- **IPC Handlers**: `src/main/ipc/handlers/CanvasHandlers.ts`
  - Exposes Canvas functionality to renderer via IPC
  - Handles: configure, testConnection, getCourses, isConfigured, getConfig, disconnect
  - Stores Canvas configuration securely in electron-store

### Renderer Process
- **Settings UI**: `src/renderer/settings.ts`
  - Canvas settings section with URL and API token inputs
  - Test connection button
  - Status indicators
  - Disconnect functionality

## Features Implemented

### 1. Canvas Configuration
- Users can enter their institution's Canvas URL
- API token input for authentication
- Credentials stored securely in electron-store
- Configuration persists across app restarts

### 2. Connection Testing
- Test button validates Canvas URL and API token
- Connects to Canvas API to verify credentials
- Provides clear success/error feedback
- Only stores credentials after successful connection

### 3. Course Fetching
- Retrieves user's enrolled courses via Canvas API
- Filters for active courses only
- Sorts courses alphabetically by name
- Ready for integration with recording interface

### 4. Status Management
- Visual status indicators (connected/not configured)
- Displays connected Canvas URL
- Disconnect button when connected
- Auto-loads connection status on app startup

## API Endpoints Used

- `GET /api/v1/users/self` - Verify authentication
- `GET /api/v1/courses?enrollment_state=active&per_page=100` - Fetch enrolled courses

## Security Considerations

✅ **Implemented**:
- API tokens stored in main process only
- No token exposure to renderer process
- Secure IPC communication
- Token validation before storage
- Connection test before accepting credentials

## User Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - User opens Settings
   - Navigates to Canvas LMS Integration section
   - Enters Canvas URL (e.g., https://canvas.university.edu)
   - Enters API token from Canvas Account Settings
   - Clicks "Test Connection"
   - Receives success confirmation

2. **Using Canvas**:
   - Canvas connection persists across sessions
   - Course list available for recording organization
   - Can disconnect and reconnect as needed

3. **Getting API Token**:
   - Log into Canvas
   - Go to Account → Settings
   - Scroll to "Approved Integrations"
   - Click "+ New Access Token"
   - Give it a purpose (e.g., "ScribeCat")
   - Copy the generated token

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- `src/domain/services/ICanvasService.ts`
- `src/infrastructure/services/canvas/CanvasService.ts`
- `src/main/ipc/handlers/CanvasHandlers.ts`
- `docs/CANVAS_LMS_INTEGRATION.md`

### Modified:
- `src/main/main.ts` - Registered Canvas handlers
- `src/preload/preload.ts` - Exposed Canvas API to renderer
- `src/shared/window.d.ts` - Added Canvas type definitions
- `src/renderer/index.html` - Added Canvas settings UI
- `src/renderer/settings.ts` - Added Canvas settings logic

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Canvas URL validation
- [ ] API token authentication
- [ ] Course fetching
- [ ] Connection persistence
- [ ] Disconnect functionality
- [ ] Error handling (invalid URL, invalid token, network errors)
- [ ] UI status updates
- [ ] Settings persistence across app restarts

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 3 Remaining Tasks:
1. **Course Selection in Recording Interface**
   - Add course dropdown to recording controls
   - Tag recordings with selected course
   - Store course info in session metadata

2. **Course-Based Organization**
   - Organize saved files by course folders
   - Filter recordings by course
   - Course-specific export options
   - Integration with Google Drive folder structure

3. **Theme System** (Next major feature)
   - 15-20 preset themes
   - Custom theme builder
   - Accessibility features
   - Theme preview and switching

## Known Limitations

1. Canvas URL must be entered manually (no auto-detection)
2. API token must be generated manually in Canvas
3. Only fetches active courses (not concluded courses)
4. Limited to 100 courses per request (pagination not implemented)

## Error Messages

- "Canvas not configured" - No credentials stored
- "Invalid API token" - 401 response from Canvas
- "Invalid Canvas URL" - 404 response or malformed URL
- "Connection failed" - Network or other errors

## Support Resources

- Canvas API Documentation: https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api
- Canvas Access Token Guide: Account → Settings → New Access Token

## Notes for Developers

- Canvas service uses fetch API for HTTP requests
- All Canvas operations are async
- Configuration is validated before storage
- Service maintains in-memory config after successful connection
- IPC handlers use BaseHandler pattern for consistent error handling
