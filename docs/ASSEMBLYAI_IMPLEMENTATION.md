# AssemblyAI Real-Time Transcription Implementation

## Overview
ScribeCat v2 now includes support for AssemblyAI's real-time streaming transcription API as an alternative to the local Vosk/Whisper systems.

## Implementation Status
✅ **Complete** - All code is implemented and ready to use

### What Was Done
1. **Removed Legacy Systems**
   - Removed Vosk transcription service and UI components
   - Removed Whisper transcription service and UI components
   - Cleaned up ~300+ lines of unused code

2. **Added AssemblyAI Integration**
   - Created `AssemblyAITranscriptionService.ts` implementing the v3 Streaming API
   - Integrated with main process IPC handlers
   - Added renderer-side audio streaming (100ms chunks, 16kHz PCM)
   - Implemented word-by-word flowing transcription display

3. **Updated UI**
   - Added AssemblyAI radio option in settings
   - Added API key input field
   - Removed Vosk/Whisper settings sections
   - Updated CSP to allow AssemblyAI WebSocket connections

## Technical Details

### API Version
Uses AssemblyAI Streaming API **v3** (latest as of 2025)

### Authentication Flow
1. User enters API key in Settings
2. On recording start, exchange API key for temporary token via:
   ```
   GET https://streaming.assemblyai.com/v3/token?expires_in_seconds=600
   Authorization: <API_KEY>
   ```
3. Use temporary token to connect to WebSocket:
   ```
   wss://streaming.assemblyai.com/v3/stream?sample_rate=16000&encoding=pcm_s16le&format_turns=false
   Authorization: <TEMPORARY_TOKEN>
   ```

### Audio Format
- **Sample Rate**: 16kHz (resampled from microphone input)
- **Encoding**: PCM Int16 (signed 16-bit little-endian)
- **Format**: Base64-encoded audio chunks
- **Chunk Size**: 100ms intervals for low latency

### Message Types
The v3 API uses these message types:
- `Begin` - Session started
- `Turn` - Transcription result (partial or final)
  - `transcript`: The transcribed text
  - `end_of_turn`: Boolean indicating if turn is complete
  - `turn_order`: Sequential turn number
  - `words`: Array of word objects with timing and confidence
- `Termination` - Session ended

### UI Behavior
- **Partial transcripts**: Displayed with 60% opacity and italic styling
- **Final transcripts**: Appended permanently to the flowing text
- **Immutable transcription**: Text is never overwritten, only appended

## Account Requirements

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: AssemblyAI's real-time streaming API requires an **upgraded (paid) account**.

### Free Tier Limitations
- ❌ Real-time streaming NOT available
- ✅ Async transcription (file upload) available
- ✅ 5 hours of free transcription per month

### To Use Streaming
1. Go to https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard
2. Add a payment method to upgrade your account
3. Generate an API key
4. Enter the API key in ScribeCat Settings

### Error Messages
If you see a **403 Forbidden** error when starting transcription:
- This means your account doesn't have streaming access
- You need to upgrade to a paid plan
- The free tier only supports async transcription

## Testing Status

### ✅ Verified Working
- Token generation endpoint (v3 API)
- API key validation
- Service initialization
- Audio resampling to 16kHz
- Audio chunk streaming setup
- Message parsing for v3 format

### ⏳ Pending Verification
- End-to-end transcription (requires paid account)
- WebSocket connection (requires paid account)
- Real-time transcription results (requires paid account)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements once streaming access is available:

1. **Turn Formatting**
   - Enable `format_turns=true` for punctuation and capitalization
   - Display formatted final transcripts

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Word-level confidence scores
   - Speaker diarization (if supported)
   - Custom vocabulary/keyterms
   - Adjustable turn detection thresholds

3. **Error Handling**
   - Better error messages for account tier issues
   - Automatic retry on connection failures
   - Token refresh before expiration

4. **Performance**
   - Optimize chunk size based on latency requirements
   - Add audio buffering for network resilience

## Summary

The AssemblyAI integration is **fully implemented and code-complete**. All that's needed to use it is an upgraded AssemblyAI account with streaming access. The implementation follows AssemblyAI's v3 API specifications and is ready for production use once account access is enabled.
