# Vosk UI Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented first-run setup dialog and model management UI for Vosk integration in ScribeCat v2.

## Components Created

### 1. VoskSetupDialog (`src/renderer/components/vosk-setup-dialog.ts`)
**Purpose:** First-run dialog that appears when Vosk model is not installed

**Features:**
- Checks if model is installed on app startup
- Shows welcome message with download size warning (~1.8GB)
- Real-time progress bar with download/extraction/validation stages
- "Skip for Now" option (stores flag in localStorage)
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Prevents closing during download (ESC disabled)
- Auto-closes after successful download

**Integration:**
- Imported and initialized in `src/renderer/app.ts`
- Runs `checkVoskSetup()` on DOMContentLoaded
- Respects localStorage skip flag

### 2. VoskSettingsSection (`src/renderer/components/vosk-settings.ts`)
**Purpose:** Model management section in settings modal

**Features:**
- Dynamic rendering based on model installation status
- **When NOT installed:**
  - Shows "Not Installed" status with ❌ icon
  - Download button
  - Progress bar during download
- **When installed:**
  - Shows "Installed" status with ✅ icon
  - Displays model info (name, size, location)
  - Re-download button (with confirmation)
  - Delete button (with confirmation)
- Real-time progress updates
- Error handling with retry capability
- Path truncation for long file paths

**Integration:**
- Imported in `src/renderer/settings.ts`
- Instantiated in SettingsManager constructor
- Refreshed when settings modal opens
- Renders into `#vosk-model-settings-container` div

## UI/UX Design

### Dialog Styling
- Modern modal with backdrop blur
- Gradient progress bar (blue theme)
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive button states (hover, disabled)
- Clear visual hierarchy

### Settings Section Styling
- Consistent with existing ScribeCat theme
- Color-coded status indicators:
  - Green border for installed
  - Red border for not installed
- Button variants:
  - Primary (blue) for download
  - Secondary (gray) for re-download
  - Danger (red) for delete
- Progress bar with gradient fill

### Color Scheme
Uses existing CSS variables:
- `--accent`: #007acc (primary blue)
- `--success`: #27ae60 (green)
- `--record-color`: #e74c3c (red)
- `--bg-primary/secondary/tertiary`: Dark theme grays
- `--text-primary/secondary/tertiary`: White/gray text

## Type Definitions

### Updated `src/shared/window.d.ts`
Added Vosk API types:
```typescript
vosk: {
  startServer: () => Promise<{...}>;
  stopServer: () => Promise<{...}>;
  isServerRunning: () => Promise<{...}>;
  model: {
    isInstalled: () => Promise<{...}>;
    getPath: () => Promise<{...}>;
    download: () => Promise<{...}>;
    delete: () => Promise<{...}>;
    onDownloadProgress: (callback) => void;
    removeDownloadProgressListener: (callback) => void;
  };
}
```

Added `DownloadProgress` interface:
```typescript
interface DownloadProgress {
  stage: 'downloading' | 'extracting' | 'validating';
  percent: number;
  downloaded?: number;
  total?: number;
}
```

## User Flow

### First-Run Experience
1. User launches ScribeCat for first time
2. App checks if Vosk model installed
3. If not installed and not previously skipped:
   - VoskSetupDialog appears
   - User can download now or skip
4. If user downloads:
   - Progress bar shows real-time status
   - Dialog auto-closes on completion
5. If user skips:
   - Flag stored in localStorage
   - Dialog won't show again this session
   - Can still download from Settings

### Settings Management
1. User opens Settings modal
2. VoskSettingsSection renders based on model status
3. User can:
   - Download model if not installed
   - Re-download model (replaces existing)
   - Delete model (with confirmation)
4. Progress shown inline during operations
5. Section refreshes after operations complete

## Error Handling

### Network Errors
- "Unable to download. Check your internet connection and try again."
- Retry button enabled

### Disk Space Errors
- "Not enough disk space. 1.8GB required."
- User must free space before retrying

### Generic Errors
- "Download failed. Please try again."
- Logs full error to console for debugging

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `src/renderer/components/vosk-setup-dialog.ts`
- `src/renderer/components/vosk-settings.ts`
- `docs/VOSK_UI_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
